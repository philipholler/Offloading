# Offloading
This project was created as a software 7th project at Aalborg University. Alongside the program a report was created and can found in this project.
The project set out to create a server capable of distributing and offloading programs to mobile phones. 
In addition to the server an [employer (Desktop) client](https://github.com/philipholler/OffloadTornadoClient) and a [worker (Android) client](https://github.com/MagnusKJensen/termux-bridged) was created.

# Running the program

Inside the .run folder are Maven run configurations used for testing and running the program. 
The database and server configurations can be changed inside the src/main/resources/application.properties and src/main/resources/openapi-definition.yaml files.

Make sure to run the ***clean compile generate server*** run configuration as the first to generate the needed files for the server using the openapi generator tool.
